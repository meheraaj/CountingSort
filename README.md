# Counting Sort in C++

This project implements the **Counting Sort** algorithm in **C++**.  
Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting technique ideal for sorting integers within a known and limited range.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Sorts a list of non-negative integers efficiently.
- **Faster than comparison-based sorts** when maximum value is reasonable.
- **Stable sort** (preserves order of equal elements).
- Time complexity depends on both the number of elements and the maximum value.

---

## ðŸš€ How Counting Sort Works

Counting Sort works by:
1. **Counting** how many times each value appears.
2. **Building a prefix sum** of counts to find final positions.
3. **Placing elements** in the correct position based on counts.

Unlike typical sorting algorithms, **it does not compare elements**.

| Algorithm         | Best Case   | Average Case | Worst Case  | Space Complexity | Stable? | Type                   |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**    | O(n)        | O(nÂ²)         | O(nÂ²)       | O(1)             | Yes     | Comparison-based       |
| **Selection Sort** | O(nÂ²)       | O(nÂ²)         | O(nÂ²)       | O(1)             | No      | Comparison-based       |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n)        | O(nÂ²)         | O(nÂ²)       | O(1)             | Yes     | Comparison-based       |
| **Merge Sort**     | O(n log n)  | O(n log n)    | O(n log n)  | O(n)             | Yes     | Comparison-based       |
| **Quick Sort**     | O(n log n)  | O(n log n)    | O(nÂ²)       | O(log n)         | No      | Comparison-based       |
| **Counting Sort**  | O(n + k)    | O(n + k)      | O(n + k)    | O(k + n)         | Yes     | Non-comparison-based   |

### ðŸ”µ Key Observations:
- **Counting Sort is faster than O(n log n) sorting algorithms** when `k` (max value) is small compared to `n`.
- If `k â‰ˆ n`, then Counting Sort behaves almost **linear O(n)**.
- **Comparison-based sorting algorithms (like Merge Sort, QuickSort)** cannot go faster than O(n log n) â€” due to a proven lower bound.

## âš¡ When to Use Counting Sort

âœ… Use Counting Sort when:
- You are sorting **only integers**.
- Maximum element value (`k`) is **not too large** (e.g., \( k \leq 10^6 \)).
- Memory usage (O(k)) is acceptable.

ðŸš« Avoid Counting Sort when:
- Numbers have a **huge range** (e.g., max value \(10^9\)).
- Sorting floating point numbers or very large numbers.
- Memory is highly constrained.

---

## ðŸ“¥ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code.
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   g++ -o countingsort countingsort.cpp
   ```
3. Execute:
   ```bash
   ./countingsort
   ```
4. Provide input:
   - First line: Number of elements (`n`)
   - Next line: `n` integers

## ðŸ§© Example

**Input:**
```
5
4 2 2 8 3
```
**Output:**
```
2 2 3 4 8
```

## ðŸ“š Fun Fact: Why Comparison Sorts Can't Beat O(n log n)

Thereâ€™s a **mathematical proof**: any algorithm based **only on comparisons** must take at least O(n log n) comparisons in the worst case.  
Counting Sort avoids this by **not comparing** â€” it uses counting instead, thus bypassing the O(n log n) lower bound.

# ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

- **Counting Sort** is extremely fast for **small-range integers** â€” almost linear time.
- It's **faster than any comparison-based sort** when conditions are right.
- But be careful about **huge ranges** and **high memory** use!
